# Lupine Systems — Master Vision (Nov 2025)

**Aiva** (ai/) — intelligence and routing · **Lupine** (rail/) — execution · **Cloked Compliance** (compliance/) — audit-ready trust.

- Use case: research & health-science funds AU↔SG↔MY.
- Philosophy: transparency without exposure; compliance without delay; trust without friction.
- 2025 Q4: simulate + anchor + verify + uncloak; scaffold rail API.
- 2026 pilot: AU↔SG↔MY; 2027: expand JP/IN/ID; 2030: AI-safe, compliance-led global rails.

This document centralises the cross-repo narrative; see `README.md` for setup and `Mission.md` for pillars.
